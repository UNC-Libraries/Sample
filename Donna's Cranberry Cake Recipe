DONNA’S CRANBERRY GRAPEFRUIT CAKE WITH BUTTER CREAM SAUCE
yield: 9 LARGER PORTIONS (FROM THE 8-INCH SQUARE PAN)cook time: 45 MINUTES

INGREDIENTS:

FOR THE CAKE:
  2 c. all-purpose flour
  1 c. sugar
  2 tsp. baking powder
  1/2 tsp. salt
  2 c. whole fresh cranberries
  1 c. milk
  3 T. butter, melted
  
FOR THE Cranberry SYRUP:
  2 Grapefruits
  1 c. sugar
  1/2 c. water
  Pinch of salt

FOR THE BUTTER CREAM SAUCE:
  1/2 c. butter
  1 c. sugar
  3/4 c. heavy cream

DIRECTIONS:
Cake:
  1. Preheat oven to 350°. Lightly spray an 8” square pan and set aside.
  2. Sift together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Add cranberries, milk, and melted butter. Mix well. Pour into prepared pan and bake for about 45 minutes, until the top is golden and an inserted toothpick comes out clean. Remove to wire rack to cool.

Grapefruit syrup:
  1. Quarter grapefruit and slice into 1/2 inch wedges.
  2. Heat water and sugar over medium low, and add grapefruit slices. Heat until reduced, stirring frequently and mashing fruit as it cooks. Remove mixture when it forms a thin syrup.
  3. Remove syrup and filter through a wire sieve, mashing fruit to extract the juice. Discard used grapefruit. 
  4. Sprinkle a pinch of salt into the syrup and allow to cool.
  5. Pour the syrup over the warm cake.

Butter cream sauce:
  1. Melt the butter in a small sauce pan over medium heat. Add sugar and cream. Bring to boiling and cook for 1 minute.
  2. To serve, pour warm Butter Cream Sauce over individual pieces of cake.

*Note: This can easily be made in a 9” x 13” pan by doubling the cake ingredients. It will just require a bit more time in the oven. I don’t think the butter cream sauce requires doubling, however. I would just do a recipe and a half of the sauce.

From Aunt Donna’s recipe box, a recipe passed down from her Aunt Evel Peterson.
